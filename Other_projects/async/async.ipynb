    "# Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "Synchronous programming happens sequentially. This means code lines are executed in order from top to bottom. \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous means tasks that take time can be awaited. This means that tasks that wait a long time can be put aside, and we can move to simultaneously trigger other tasks, while we wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can help a lot with minimising the execution time of certain types of tasks like requests and parrallel tasks. However, this will not improve the preformance of tasks chains that are dependant on the output of previous tasks, as we would still have to wait for the output to arrive if we need it for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not multi threading, it is just switching off the processing to another function while waiting for the response.\n"

    "There are a few parts to this process. Asynchronous functions are not normal functions. In python they are called co-routines. To create a co-routine we use the ```async``` keyword prior to our normal function definition.\n",
    "In order to run a async function (co-routine) we must create an **event loop**. An event loop tracks the execution of the parts of your programme, and transfers the processing to other parts of the code while you are waiting on specific outputs. To create an event loop we execute our asynchronous function using the ```asyncio.run()``` function.\n",
    "The event loop must be told which parts of the code must run sequentially, and which parts can run asynchronously. For this inside our ```async``` functions we use the keyword ```await```.\n",
    "This seems intuitive, however, we can not create single lines of code that will run asynchronously within a single coroutine. You have to create a coroutine with an await statement, and then build that into a secondary coroutine that runs the initial coroutine. Because of this, we should create as many async coroutines as necessary and then run them using a 'parent' async coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have to use nest_asyncio as Jupyter notebooks require it as these types of files keep the event loop 'live'. In normal circumstances we wouldn't need that."

    "🐍 Asyncio Cheat Sheet: Core Concepts\n",
    "1. async def (The Definition)\n",
    "Purpose: Defines a function as a coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does: It tells Python, \"This isn't a normal function; it's a task that can pause and resume.\" Calling this function returns a coroutine object but does not execute the code inside immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. await (The Yield)\n",
    "Purpose: Pauses the current coroutine and hands control back to the Event Loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does: It signals, \"I am waiting for this specific operation to finish. Event Loop, go run other tasks in the meantime.\" > Note: await can only be used inside an async def function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. asyncio.create_task() (The Backgrounder)\n",
    "Purpose: Schedules a coroutine to run immediately in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does: It wraps a coroutine into a \"Task\" and adds it to the loop's queue. This allows the code to move to the next line without waiting for the task to finish, enabling concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. asyncio.gather() (The Batcher)\n",
    "Purpose: Runs multiple coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does: It is a high-level tool to manage multiple tasks. It returns a list of results once the slowest task completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. asyncio.run() (The Ignition)\n",
    "Purpose: The entry point that starts the engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does: It creates the Event Loop, runs the passed \"main\" coroutine, and shuts down the loop once finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter: You often don't need asyncio.run() because Jupyter runs its own event loop. You can often just use await main_function()."

    "So basically we create asynchronous \"functions\" with the keyword ```async```. We must use the ```await``` keyword to get the event loop to go to do other tasks at specific points. This in of itself is not really that useful within a single coroutine. If we think of what is going on during the coroutine, we tell the event loop to stop execution of the particular function, until that particular sentence of code is completed. This is how it normally works anyway even without async.\n",
    "Where this becomes important is when we can combine multiple ```await``` statements, which has the potential to start many separate tasks, while waiting for others to be completed. To do this we must create many 'child' coroutines, and have a 'parent' coroutine to run them. In the parent we create tasks to run each child coroutine. This would be fine, except that by creating tasks we are not letting the 'parent' coroutine know what tasks to await before finishing execution. For this reason we must ```await``` each task within the parent coroutine. This can be done in a single step by using the built in ```gather()``` function. Finally we must use the ```.run()``` function to create and trigger the event loop.\n",
